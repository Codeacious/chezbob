- Dependencies

  python3.4
  pip
  python-virtualenv

- Instalation

  Once the dependencies are installed, just run (as yourself)
devel_scripts/setup_devel.sh. This will create a deploy/ directory and install a virtual python environment in
deploy/. It will then install the needed python packages in the virtual environment.

  Also, you will need a dummy sqlite database file. You can find one at
ssh://yourself@soda:~dimo/app.db. Just copy that into the deploy/ directory.

- Use
  To deploy the ChezBob Interface, you need to activate the virtual environment using

source deploy/bin/activate

  At this point you should be able to kick off a version of the front-end by running:

  ./bob2k14/soda_serve.py serve sqlite:////<path-to-deploy>/app.db --log_level=DEBUG

And be able to login using your normal username and password (as of 08/12/2014).

- Notes:
  We still don't have working mocks for:
  - Vending Server
  - Bill Reader Server
  - Barcode Scanner Server
  - Any of the admin-relevant tables in the database
  - The admin interface itself.

  Those are upcoming :)
