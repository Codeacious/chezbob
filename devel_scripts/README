1. Instalation

1) Install all dependencies

dimo@fry:~/poke/chezbob/chezbob$ ./devel_scripts/setup.sh 

2) Building chezbob

./devel_scripts/build.sh

3) Using the dev interface:

Run from the base of the repo:

./devel_scripts/soda --deploy /tmp
/home/bob/chezbob/devel_scripts/../bob2k14//soda_server/app.js
/home/bob/chezbob/devel_scripts/../bob2k14//barcode_server/app.js
/home/bob/chezbob/devel_scripts/../bob2k14//barcodei_server/app.js
/home/bob/chezbob/devel_scripts/../bob2k14//vdb_server/app.js
/home/bob/chezbob/devel_scripts/../bob2k14//mdb_server/app.js
soda>

The above command will start all neccessary servers, and drop you in a javascript repl that you can use to simulate hardware events happening on the soda machine. To exit the interface type Control+C twice (or Control+D once)

(^C again to quit)
soda>
Shutting down mdb
Shutting down vdb
Shutting down barcodei
Shutting down barcode
Shutting down soda
{ '0': 'Server %s shut down', '1': 'soda' }

As you can see this cleanly shuts down all servers. Note that chezbob is
deployed from the current repo. So any changes you make will be visible as soon
as you re-build (using ./devel_scripts/build.sh).

If the address of the soda machine is for example 192.168.56.101, then from the host machine you can view thew:
