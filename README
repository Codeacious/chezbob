This is the source code and various other assorted documents for Chez
Bob, the UCSD graduate student food co-op.  The rough organization of
files in this repository is:
    admin/
        Old administrative scripts and documentation.  Has not been
        recently updated or used.
    barcodes/
        Data and code for generating extra UPC barcodes for products.
    bobmenu/
        Source code for the Chez Bob text interface.
    finance/
        Code for financial analysis and some financial records.
    sshb/
        Old utility to permit ssh logins from chezbob to remote
        computers.  No longer used.
    www/
        Chez Bob public web pages.
These files are subject to reorganization; however, if directories are
changed, this file should be updated to match.

Revision history for many of these files was imported from the CVS
repository on the old Chez Bob computer, for historical completeness.

Note that some data in some of the directories could be considered
sensitive, such as notes about old closed accounts.  As a result, please
do not make the files contained in this repository publicly accessible
or distribute to others outside Chez Bob without first taking care to
filter out the sensitive data.
