<h1>Chez Bob: The Grad Student Food Co-Op</h1>

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

<h2>What's with all the food in here?</h2>
<p>Almost all the food and drinks in the grad lounge belong to Chez Bob,
the CSE graduate student food co-op, and are available for purchase by
<em>you</em>.</p>

<h2>How do I create an account?</h2>

<p>Before you can purchase any food from Chez Bob, you'll need to create
an account with the Bank of Bob (BoB).  If you don't already have an
account, creating one is easy: simply type in a username at the computer
on the table in front of you, and if an account by that name doesn't
already exist, you'll be prompted to create one.  Be sure to provide a
valid e-mail address so we can contact you if necessary.</p>

<h2>How do I pay for items?</h2>

<p>Chez Bob doesn't have a limitless supply of funds to provide free
food to graduate students, unfortunately.  Instead, we buy items in bulk
and sell them to you close to cost.  To keep Chez Bob running smoothly,
it's extremely important that you pay for the items that you take.</p>

<p>Here's how the system works:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Deposit money into the metal box next to the Chez Bob
  computer.</li>
  <li>After doing so, log in to your BoB account, select "Add Money",
  and enter the amount of money you just deposited.</li>
  <li>When taking food, scan the item with the barcode scanner so the
  amount can be properly deducted from your account.</li>
</ol>
<p>The BoB computer system will keep track of how much money you have
left to purchase items, and will display this amount when you are logged
in.  We do allow your balance to dip negative, but you should try to
keep your account balance non-negative.  This, too, is extremely
important.</p>

<p>To make work easier for the students who run Chez Bob, fewer larger
deposits are preferred over numerous small deposits.  $5 bills are
better than $1; $10s and $20s are even better.  Coins in the box are
strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>This all runs on the honor system, so please be honest!</p>

<h2>What about the soda machine?</h2>

<p>The soda machine is the newest addition to Chez Bob.  It is
integrated with the Bank of Bob to allow for easy payment, has several
options for biometric logins, and, of course, dispenses cold
beverages.</p>

<p>There are several ways to log in to the soda machine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Log in to the Chez Bob computer, then select the "Soda Login" menu
  item.</li>
  <li>Press "Login" on the touchscreen and use the on-screen
  keyboard.</li>
  <li>Press your fingerprint to the fingerprint reader, after
  registering a fingerprint with your account.</li>
  <li>Scan your ID card with the barcode reader, if you've registered a
  barcode with your account (you can do so from the Chez Bob
  computer).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once logged in, you may use the soda machine to purchase items or to
deposit money:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any money inserted into the soda machine while you are logged in
  will be credited to your BoB account.</li>
  <li>Pressing a button for soda while logged in will dispense the item
  and debit your account.</li>
  <li>Scanning an item with the barcode scanner will charge your
  account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How can I contact Chez Bob?</h2>

<p>If you'd like to send questions or comments to the people running
Chez Bob, you have several options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send an e-mail message to
  <a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the "Message" menu item from the Chez Bob computer to leave
  a message (either signed or anonymous).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Help!  I made a mistake!</h2>

<p>If you accidentally said that you deposited $100 without doing so, or
purchased an item you didn't mean to, don't panic!  Just send a message
to Chez Bob (see previous question) letting us know, and we'll fix the
problem.</p>

<p>While you might try to fix the problem yourself by entering a fake
purchase or deposit to correct your account, we prefer that you contact
us instead of doing so, since these fake transactions can still throw
off our accounting.</p>
