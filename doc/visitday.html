free items.</p>

<h3>What is Chez Bob?</h3>

<p>Chez Bob is a department food co-op run by grad students, and located
in the grad student lounge (CSE 3154).  We buy food and drinks in bulk
from Costco, and sell them to grad students (and faculty and staff and
visitorsâ€¦) at just slightly above cost.</p>

<p>Chez Bob runs on an honor system: food and drinks made available in
the grad lounge, and people pay for them by leaving money in a box in
the grad lounge.  (And the best part is: the honor system actually
works!)</p>

<p>To make things even easier, we've created the Bank of Bob (BoB) and a
computer system for tracking purchases.  Users can create an account,
deposit money into their account, purchase items with a barcode scanner,
and have the purchase price automatically deducted from their account.
The BoB computer will automatically track how much each user has left to
purchase food (or how much Bob is owed).</p>

<h3>What does this mean to me?</h3>

<p><strong>Free snacks!</strong>  We've created a Chez Bob account for
you during visit days.  Feel free to buy an item or two on us while
you're here.</p>

<p>If for some reason you aren't getting enough other free food and want
to buy more from Chez Bob, you can deposit money into the visitday
account or even create an account of your own.</p>

<h3>How do I log in?</h3>

<p>To log in to the Chez Bob computer, you have a few options:
<ul>
  <li>Type in a username at the Chez Bob computer.</li>
  <li>Scan a user barcode with the barcode scanner.</li>
</ul>
For the soda machine:
<ul>
  <li>Log in to the Chez Bob computer and select "Soda Login".</li>
  <li>Log in with an on-screen keyboard at the soda machine.</li>
  <li>Scan a user barcode with the barcode scanner.</li>
  <li>Register a fingerprint with the system, and log in by simply
    scanning a finger.</li>
  <li>(Under development.)  Log in via a face-recognition system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I buy items?</h3>

<p>Even though we're letting you take a few items for free, we'd still
like you to scan them as usual, so we can keep track.</p>

<p>To "purchase" items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any drinks vended by the soda machine while logged in are
    tracked.</li>
  <li>Any other items with barcodes can be scanned at either the soda
    machine or Chez Bob computer.</li>
  <li>For a few miscellaneous items without barcodes, use the "Extra
    Items" menu on the Chez Bob computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're curious about prices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All items in the soda machine are $0.45, except bottled water
    (which is $0.25).</li>
  <li>Scanning any item at the Chez Bob computer will display the
    price.</li>
  <li>The "Extra Items" menu lists prices for these extra items.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions?</h3>

<p>If you have questions about Chez Bob, ask just about any grad student
in the department.  Or, you can send messages to
<a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
