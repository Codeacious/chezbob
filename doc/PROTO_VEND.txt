*** VMC-CLI interface ***

VMC is vending machine controller. It is responsible for processing buttons on front panel and 
actually giving out the soda cans. It can be in one of the following
states:

  OFFLINE             - the machine is powered off or the cable is disconnected;
                         or the service is starting up or there is jam/total out-of-stock
  READY               - the machine is ready, but not in session.
                        all buttons are ignored in this mode
  SESSION             - the machine in the session mode.
                        any button press will cause VEND-REQUEST message
  CONFIRM             - the machine has sent VEND-REQUEST message and now expecting 
                        VEND-APPROVED or VEND-DENIED message
  DISPENSE            - the machine has recieved VEND-APPROVED message and is now 
                        dispensing product

Command:  VEND-RESET
Required mode: any
 Causes the reset of VMC, putting it eventually into READY mode. 
 Sends VEND-READY when done,

Callback: VEND-READY
Resulting mode: READY
 This callback is sent when vending machine controller is booted, and ready. After the callback
 is recieved, machine is in the READY mode.
 This message could be sent at any time, even in the middle of transaction - all UI will be typically
 reset as a result of it. This is followed by VEND-STATE message if the state was change.

Callback: VEND-OFFLINE<tab>reason
Resulting mode: OFFLINE
 This callback is called when the machine is stuck in the offline mode for 
 a long time. In this mode, machine cannot start session. If VMC fixes itself, then 
 VEND-READY will be issued
 The "reason" gives the reason for offline:
    DISABLED      - disabled by VMC (all prodfucts out of stock, machine jam)
    DISCONNECTED  - no response from VMC (cable unplugged, VMC powered down)

Command: VEND-STATUS
 This command requests re-send of all status messages. As a result of this command.
  VEND-STATE is re-send.
 Note that during state changes, state reported may be insconsistent with last message - 
  for example, after VEND-RESET, VMC goes thru DISCONNECTED, DISABLED, and REAYD modes,
  but only last one will be reported to user

Callback: VEND-STATE<tab>status
 This callback notifies that the new state is active. It is only issued as a response to VEND-STATUS
  message

Command:  VEND-SSTART<tab>available-money
Required mode: READY
Resulting mode: SESSION
 This command starts a new session. The display will show available-money (which should be in
 cents). Warning: if the amount is less than cost of the soda can, the corresponding button
 will be blocked. 

Callback: VEND-REQUEST<tab>button-number<tab>price
Required mode: SESSION
Resulting mode: CONFIRM
 This callback is sent when the button is pressed. The buttons are numbered upside down.
 'price' is item price in cents, as machine remembers it.
 The UI must respond to that with VEND-DENIED or VEND-GRANTED command.

Command:  VENT-DENIED
Required mode: CONFIRM
Resulting mode: SESSION
 Denies the vend - the machine goes into SESSION mode, but display now shows the price 
 of the selection.

Command:  VEND-APPROVED
Command:  VEND-APPROVED<tab>real-price
Required mode: CONFIRM
Resulting mode: DISPENSE
 Approves the vend - the machine tries to give the soda.
 If real-price is specified, the machine will show 'money-available'-'real-price' for a second.
 The message will be followed with VEND-SUCCESS or VEND-FAILED callback

Callback: VEND-FAILED
Required mode: DISPENSE
Resulting mode: SESSION
 The vend did not go thru. Most common reason is out-of-stock.
 Machine stays in SESSION mode

Callback: VEND-SUCCESS<tab>price
Required mode: DISPENSE
Resulting mode: READY or SESSION
 The vend worked - the user got the soda. Account should be deduced.

Command: VEND-SCANCEL
Required mode: SESSION
 Asks VMC to cancel current session. This message will be followed by VEND-SDONE

Callback: VEND-SDONE
Required mode: SESSION
Resulting mode: READY
 Notifies that VMC session ended. Could appear after sucessful vend, or after timeout.

Callback: VEND-STAT<tab>index<tab>name<tab>value
 Statistics information. All non-zero fields are reported.
 'index' decreases, so last record has an index of 0.
