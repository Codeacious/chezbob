*** Your B.o.B.2k account has a balance of $%balance%. ***

This is the third consecutive month in which your balance has had a
balance less than -$5.  PLEASE BRING YOUR ACCOUNT UP TO DATE AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE!

I cannot continue to maintain debts on my personal credit card for the
sake of allowing Chez Bob users to maintain debts to the co-op.
Thanks for your understanding.
