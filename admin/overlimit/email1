Hi, %username%

Your chezbob account balance is now  %balance%. 
Glad you like the stuff chezbob is providing, but keep in mind that 
this is a "co-op" so it's a "put-in-money-first" based system. 

Chezbob is run entirely by students, and as the one that is taking
care of its financial situation, I'm trying to maintain a positive
balance of chezbob so that the cabinet will be always restored soon
and better. Certainaly, if the money is always hiding in the negative
 accounts, my job becomes very hard.

Remember to put in some money next time you meet with bob, and try to
keep your balance above or near $0.
