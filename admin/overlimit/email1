Subject: Chez Bob balance...

Hello %username%-

This is a semi-automated message from CSE department food co-op!  If
you're receiving this message, it means our records indicate that you
currently have a negative balance of more than $5.

*** Your B.o.B.2k account has a balance of $%balance%. ***

Please realize that this is a student run organization, and any debts
you owe to Chez Bob are actually debts that we are forced to float on
our PERSONAL credit cards.  As our department is growing, this is
now becoming a substantial hardship for us.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could try to keep any negative
balances less than $5, in order to minimize possible cash flow
problems and to help us keep Chez Bob better stocked.

Thanks!
