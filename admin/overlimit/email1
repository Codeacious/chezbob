Hello %username%-

The Chez Bob database indicates that you currently have a negative
balance of $%balance%.

I'm currently in the process of handing off the financial
responsibility of the co-op; however, this process can't start until
co-op has enough cash to pay off the debt it has to me.  Moreover,
Chez Bob was originally concieved as a "pay first" system; as such, it
would be very helpful if you could keep your account current.
Remember, every dollar you owe becomes a debt that I (a poor student!)
or the next Chez Bob organizer (also a poor student!) must finance in
terms of personal credit card debt.

Please make an effort to bring your balance above $0 as soon as
possible.  Thanks!
