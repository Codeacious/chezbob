Hello %username%-

*** Your B.o.B.2k account has a balance of $%balance%. ***

Chez Bob is a co-operative operation, meaning we cannot function with
large debts outstanding.  The co-op was originally conceived with the
idea that users would maintain *POSITIVE* balances.  While we
understand you may be busy and may allow your balance to become
negative, the cumulative effect of many users doing this is
tremendously difficult for us.  As our department grows (and our
minimal resources as GRAD STUDENTS remains the same), we are beginning
to experience cash flow issues which threaten the long-term viability
of Chez Bob.

Please take the necessary steps to ensure that your Chez Bob account
is current (i.e. at least near a $0 balance!). Thanks for your
cooperation.
