Subject: Your Old Chez Bob Account (%USERNAME%)

| Chez Bob, the UCSD CSE grad student food co-op, has been sorting
| through old accounts.  According to our records, you have an account
| with Chez Bob (%USERNAME%) which has not been used since %LASTSEEN%.
| This account currently has a balance of $%BALANCE%.

| We are happy to keep the account open for you if you like; simply make
| a transaction or send an e-mail.  If you wish to close the account,
| you have several options for your remaining balance:
  - We can give you a refund if you stop by UCSD.
  - You may transfer the funds to another Chez Bob user.
  - You may donate the funds to Chez Bob.
| We aren't at this time mailing out refunds because of the hassle
| involved.

| Chez Bob recently upgraded the lounge with a second, larger
| refrigerator, and donations will help us cover the cost and would be
| much appreciated.  However, the choice of what to do with the funds is
| up to you.

| If we don't hear from you and there are no further transactions on
| your account, we will default to donating the balance to Chez Bob.  To
| let us know otherwise, send me an e-mail or send an e-mail to
| chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu.
