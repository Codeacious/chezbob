| Chez Bob, the UCSD CSE grad student food co-op, has been sorting
| through some of our accounts and found that you still seem to owe Chez
| Bob money.  According to our records, your account %USERNAME%
| currently owes %ABSBALANCE%.

| We haven't seen you make any transactions since %LASTSEEN%, so we're
| worried that you may have left.  If you are still around the
| department, we'd appreciate it if you could pay off your debt.  If you
| are no longer here, you can also see the page
    http://chezbob.ucsd.edu/payment/?user=%USERNAME%&amt=%ABSBALANCE%
| for payment instructions (payments can be mailed or Google Checkout can
| be used to pay electronically).

| If you believe our records are incorrect, please contact us so that we
| may correct them.  To do so, you may either send a message to
| chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu or to Nathan Bales (one of the current finance
| managers) at nbales@cs.ucsd.edu.
