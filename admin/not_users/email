Hi %USER%-

This is a semi-automatic message from your friendly food co-op!

Our records show that you currently have a Chez Bob index card with a
balance, and have *not* signed up to use the new computerized Bank of
Bob 2000 (B.o.B. 2k) system!  By the end of this month, Chez Bob will
operate exclusively on the B.o.B. 2k system, eliminating the index
card method of tracking.

Please reply to this mail and indicate which of the following applies
to you:

 [ ] What are you talking about?  I'm already using B.o.B. 2k!

 [ ] What are you talking about?  What's this Chez Bob thing?

 [ ] I am no longer affiliated with the CSE department at UCSD.  Feel
     free to throw my card away.

 [ ] I am still affiliated with the CSE department at UCSD, but I am
     currently not in the area.  Feel free to transfer the balance
     indicated on my index card to the B.o.B. 2k system.

 [ ] I am still affiliated with the CSE department at UCSD, and I will
     transfer the information on my index card to a B.o.B. 2k account
     before the end of the month.

 [ ] I have a compelling reason to continue using the index card
     method to track my Chez Bob balance (indicate below):
