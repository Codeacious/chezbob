<h1>Chez Bob FAQ</h1>

<h2>What is Chez Bob's privacy policy?</h2>
<p>Information collected by Chez Bob can only be accessed by a few of
the people running it, and then will only be viewed if required.
Additionally, Chez Bob attempts to minimize the amount of personal data
stored.</p>

<p>You may at any time view a list of your past transactions by
selecting the “Transactions” menu item at the Chez Bob computer.
Transaction data is deleted after approximately three months to enhance
privacy—the only purchase records kept longer than this are anonymized.
If you wish to do so, enabling the “Privacy” option under “My Chez Bob”
provides additional protection: in your transaction log, only the prices
of items purchased is recorded, not their exact type.</p>

<p>The e-mail address you provide when creating your account may be used
to contact you, such as if we notice some problem with your account or
your account seems to be inactive but has a non-zero balance.  Your
e-mail address will never be shared with others.</p>

<p>If your account has a significant negative balance (you owe $5.00 or
more), your account may appear on the Chez Bob
<a href="wall_of_shame.html">Wall of Shame</a>.  If you keep your
account balance positive, your account will never be displayed.</p>

<p>If you'd like more details of exactly what information we track, feel
free to <a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I purchase items without a barcode?</h2>
<p>If you're trying to purchase an item without a barcode, check the
“Extra Items” menu item at the Chez Bob computer to see if the item you
want is listed there.  If it's not,
<a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">contact Chez Bob</a> to let us know
so we can fix it.</p>

<p>While you can make purchases with the “Buy Other” menu item, we
discourage this (where possible) since it does not allow for inventory
tracking.</p>

<h2>Can I purchase items anonymously?</h2>
<p>For the ultimate in privacy, it is possible to make cash-only
purchases of items from Chez Bob.  This works only with the soda
machine, since only it can give out change.  Without logging in, deposit
money in the soda machine.  Then, push a button or scan the barcode for
the item you want.</p>

<p>We ask that you do not simply deposit cash in the cash box and walk
off with an item.  Doing so throws off both estimates of how much cash
has been deposited and inventory estimates.</p>

<h2>What happens to inactive accounts?</h2>
<p>If your account goes inactive and you owe Chez Bob money—please,
don't do that!  Chez Bob will likely try to contact you to let you know
about your debt, and to try to collect.  It isn't fair to force current
users of Chez Bob to pay what you owed when you left, so try not to do
this!</p>

<p>If your account has a non-negative balance and has not been used in
over a year, we may attempt to contact you to see if you'd like to keep
the account open.  We are happy to keep the account open as long as you
wish (as long as you are still reachable).  If you wish to close the
account, you may transfer the remaining balance to another user or
donate it to Chez Bob.  If we are unable to contact you regarding your
account, or if we hear no response, we may close your account and donate
the remaining balance to Chez Bob.</p>

<h2>Does Chez Bob give account balance refunds?</h2>
<p>If you are leaving and have money left in your account, you may ask
for a refund of your account balance.  The availability of refunds is at
the discretion of Chez Bob, however, and will depend on factors such as
current cash on hand, Chez Bob's financial situation, and the amount of
the refund requested.  Alternately, you may donate your remaining
balance to Chez Bob or transfer the amount to another user's
account.</p>

<h2>How does Chez Bob spend its profits?</h2>
<p>The goal of Chez Bob is not to make those that run it wealthy.  We
aim to spend any profits from running Chez Bob in ways that will enrich
the department (for example, contributing funding to events such as
graduate student barbecues), or to lower prices.</p>

<h2>What happened to the speech synthesis?</h2>
<p>Speech synthesis functionality in Chez Bob 2001 was not kept up to
date during the last several operating system and hardware upgrades to
the Chez Bob computer.  Speech synthesis might still make a return at
some point.</p>

<h2>Why won't the barcode scanner work on my soda can?</h2>
<p>Make sure you wipe off any condensation on the barcode before trying
to scan it.  Also, try to hold the can a bit lower so that the beam hits
the can at a slight angle.</p>

<h2>What's the best type of money to deposit?</h2>
<p>Glad you asked!  We have a <b>strong</b> preference for bills, and
large ones.  Coins, especially smaller than quarters, are frowned upon.
Just to give you and idea, take a look at this graph:</p>
