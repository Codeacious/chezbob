SELENIUM ORDER AUTOMATION

1. To use the selenium python order automator, you must first install the selenium python package:

	pip install -U selenium

2. You must also install Firefox:

	https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

3. Create a file called "creds.txt" - the format of creds.txt is two lines, the first being your Costco username, the second your Costco password, as such:

   		username
   		password

If you don't want to create this file, you will be prompted for your username and password upon execution.

4. Make the order file. Go to https://chezbob.ucsd.edu/admin/inventory/order/ and select the button "Estimate." Copy the contents of this file into file "order_estimate.txt"

5. It's time. Run the following command:

	python fill_cart.py

It will open Firefox and run for a while. Once Firefox closes, you can log into your Costco Business account and the cart will be filled :)
