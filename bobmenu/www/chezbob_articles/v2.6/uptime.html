<h1>CSE Uptime Updates for 1990-91</h1>

<b>T</b>here is information in previous issues of <b>CSE Uptime</b> for 1990-91
which has been superceded by subsequent developments:<p>
<p>
<b><u>Sun Write/Paint/Draw</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
Sun Write/Paint/Draw does not work under SunOS 4.1.1, the operating system
level to which all CSE Suns have been upgraded.  Because of the relatively low
demand for this product, and the number of requests for FrameMaker,
<i>csehelp</i> will not purchase the replacement product, Island
Write/Paint/Draw.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Weather Servers</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
In <b>CSE Uptime</b> v.2, n.3 (March 1991), there was an article about weather
servers.  Since that time, Alden/Zephyr, the company which provides weather
data to the University of Illinois (wxmap) and University of Washington (finger
weather-help@stormy.<p>
atmos.washington.edu ), has stated that these institutions cannot release any
data obtained from Alden/Zephyr without paying an additional rebroadcast
license fee.  <p>
<p>
Until some group at UCSD decides to license this data from Alden/Zephyr, the
only weather options currently available at CSE are courtesy of SIO and the
Linguistics department:<p>
<pre>
	rlogin sdsio -l weather
</pre>
and
<pre>
	finger weather@bend
</pre>
<b><u>Department Food Coop</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
The food cooperative referred to in v.1, n.10 (November 1990) and v.1, n.11
(December 1990) has changed names from CCCP to Chez Bob.
