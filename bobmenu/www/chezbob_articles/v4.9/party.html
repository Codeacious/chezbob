 <h1>All CSE Fall Beach Party</h1>

Saturday, September 25<p>
           
Remember to mark your calendars for this year's All CSE Fall Beach Party and
Bar-B-Que scheduled for Saturday, September 25, in Kellogg Park at La Jolla
Shores (grassy area north of the main parking lot).
<p>
The picnic will once again be fully sponsored by our own Chez Bob - the great
folks who bring us the 4th floor Chez Bob co-op. Since Chez Bob is strictly a
volunteer effort, they are looking for people to help out with various aspects of
organizing and running the beach party. Please contact Eric Anderson (ewa@cs)
if you can help out.
<p>
Additional information about the picnic will be emailed to csepeople soon.
