<img align=left src="Smile.gif">
<b>E</b>ric Anderson joins the CSE Computing facility support staff as a 50%
Programmer/Analyst.  He will be joining Cindy Paloma, Glenn Little, and David
Hutches in answering the many software-related questions that are posed to
<i>csehelp</i>, in addition to installing and maintaining software, and of
course, writing <b>CSE Uptime</b> articles!<p>
<p>
Eric is a familiar face around UCSD and CSE. He started his undergraduate
career at UCSD in September 1985 and graduated with a degree in Computer
Science.  Since September 1989, Eric has been a graduate student in CSE.
During 1990-1991, he served as a CSE graduate student representative.
Currently, he is serving as the president of the CSE graduate student
association.  Eric is also an active member of Chez Bob, the food cooperative
located in the CSE lounge.<p>
<p>
Eric will continue his Ph.D. studies under the guidance of Dr. Joe Pasquale
while working half-time as a member of <i>csehelp</i>.  As a participant in the
Sequoia 2000 project, Eric has gained considerable experience with the all
levels of network and system administration.  Other previous experience that
will be relevant to his new position as a member of <i>csehelp</i> included
programming positions, one of which took him to Japan for 3 months to design
and support a business application.<p>
<p>
When asked about his thoughts on joining <i>csehelp</i>, Eric replied: "I look
forward to taking over Jim Mattson's position, and to forwarding all of the
hardest questions to him in Scotland" and "Will I ever graduate?"  (Sorry Eric,
Jim almost certainly filters his mail!  His stay with <i>csehelp</i> was 3.5
years -- your mileage may vary.)<p>
<p>
It is certain that Eric's experience as well as his familiarity with CSE
department computing facilities will make him an exceptional addition to
<i>csehelp</i>.<p>
<p>
Welcome aboard!
<p>
<i>Cindy Paloma</i> -- Supervisor, CSE Systems Support Group<p>
