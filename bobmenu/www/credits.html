<H1>History</H1>

<P>This is an organization with a rich history and steeped in culture.
OK, maybe not, but you wouldn't be at this page unless you were at
least a little interested, so here goes.</P>

 <TD VALIGN=top>c. 1988</TD>

 <TD>The <B>CCCP</B> (<B>C</B>offee and <B>C</B>andy
 <B>C</B>o-o<B>P</B>) was formed by Jim Mattson and Sue Merritt.
 Roughly 6 different brands of soda, 6 different types of candy
 bars, and coffee (all from Costco) were orignially stocked.  A week's
 Weekly resupply trips were made with Sue's Toyota Corolla as the
 vehicle of choice.  At this point, the grad lounge didn't even exist!
 The co-op operated in 3218, then the department library, using a
 makeshift <A HREF=images/lockbox.jpg>lockbox</A> epoxied to a
 table.</TD>

</TR>

<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>1990(?)</TD>

 <TD>After a brief period during which it was unclear who ran the
 co-op, Robert Bowdidge and Bob Carragher took on the responsibility
 of the co-op, vowing to breathe life back into the empty co-op.
 Shortly thereafter, Eric Anderson joined the pair to ensure the
 co-op's survival.  The new vehicle of choice: a 1978 Chevy Impala.
 With the new leadership came a <A
 HREF=chezbob_articles/v2.6/uptime.html>new name</A>: <B>Chez
 Bob.</B>  A recent excavation effort yielded <A
 HREF=images/old_door.jpg>a piece of a vintage Chez Bob cabinet</A>,
 which our advanced artifact dating techniques have shown probably
 originated from about this time.</TD>

</TR>

<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>1991</TD>

 <TD>The allocation of the current grad student lounge, in combination
 with the enthusiasm of the new management transformed the co-op into
 <A HREF=chezbob_articles/v3.4/chezbob.article.html>something much
 larger</A>, spending about $1000 each month on an increasingly larger
 variety of goods.  The department rejoiced.  Yay!</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>1996-1997</TD>

 <TD>Jeremy Sussman ran Chez Bob.</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>1997-1998</TD>

 <TD>Paul Blair and Adam Taylor ran Chez Bob.</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>Summer 1998</TD>

 <TD>Alan Su began running Chez Bob.</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>March 26, 1999</TD>

 <TD>On this date, the first version of <B>B.o.B. 2k</B> (Bank of Bob
 2000) was deployed in the grad lounge, using an AMD K6 233MHz linux
 machine.  The initial version of the software was a single Perl
 script making calls to the <B>dialog</B>(1) command line utility for
 creating user interfaces.  Balance information is stored in a
 PostgreSQL database.  Thanks to CSEHelp (for the machine) and the
 UCSD GSA (for the monitor).</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>September 21, 1999</TD>

 <TD>Having more or less successfully weaned the department's current
 users of the system from the legacy <A
 HREF=images/cards.jpg>&quot;index card&quot; accounting system</A>,
 all Chez Bob users were now proud owners of B.o.B. 2K accounts.
 Students, staff, and faculty who joined the department after this
 date have never had the joy of tracking their co-op balance on cute
 little colored index cards.</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>September, 2000</TD>

 <TD>Sadly, the initial chezbob.ucsd.edu machine became unstable, due
 to a combination of a failing disk and bad memory.  So,
 chezbob.ucsd.edu was &quot;upgraded&quot; to a Pentium 90 MHz linux
 machine with 64 MB of memory.  This is the current
 configuration.</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>Spring 2001</TD>

 <TD>An intrepid CSE 210 (Software Engineering) group (see below)
 decided that the existing Chez Bob interface, in concept and
 implementation, lacekd purity.  Together with the Chez Bob management
 and Prof. Bill Griswold, this group of students set out to change the
 face of Chez Bob.  Aside from greatly improving the readability and
 maintainability of the code, a barcode reader was added to the
 system, and a sound card and speech synthesizer was included to give
 Chez Bob a <A HREF=bob.wav>voice</A>.  Finally, an innovative <A
 HREF=http://chezbob.ucsd.edu/> web interface</A> was added.  This
 system was dubbed <B>B.o.B. 2001</B>.</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>Spring 2001</TD>

 <TD>Concurrent with the new B.o.B. 2001 system, the job of running
 Chez Bob was formally split into several roles and incorporated into
 the <A HREF=http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/groups/csegsa/>CSE Graduate
 Student Association</A>.  With the help of the CSEGSA, Chez Bob
 should continue to flourish and provide the department with
 research-inducing food and beverage.</TD>

</TR>
  
<TR>

 <TD VALIGN=top>Today</TD>

 <TD>Currently, Chez Bob has over 200 active users and moves nearly
 $1500 in food, drink, and candy per month.  We continue to <A
 HREF=chezbob_articles/v4.9/party.html>help fund parties</A>, buy food
 for poor comps-takers, and hopefully make life in our department that
 much more enjoyable!</TD>

</TR>

<P>Many of the links in the above history refer to documents from the
<A HREF=http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/csehelp/docs/CSE_Uptime>CSEHelp Uptime
newsletter</A> which was published when Chez Bob was first formed.
The articles which reference Chez Bob (or its precursor, the CCCP)
are archived <A HREF=chezbob_articles>here</A>.  This history was
reconstructed through the collective memories of Robert Bowdidge, Bob
Carragher, David Hutches, Andrew Kahng, Jim Mattson, Susan Merritt,
and Alan Su.</P>
