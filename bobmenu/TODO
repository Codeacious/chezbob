This file contains a list improvements people would like to see to Chez Bob.
Some information was taken from a chez bob survey conducted on 6/7/01.  
Refer to www/bob_survey.html.

Immediate Need:
---------------

- barcode login still isn't particularly popular.  people don't like the idea
of breaking out their wallet to get to their student id card.  i've personally
found the barcode on a keychain idea very convenient.  might be nice to 
provide a box of pre-made bob keychains with unique barcodes.

- a way of handling items that don't have barcodes.  could have a keychain 
of barcodes for each product, but that's kind of a pain.  




Long Term:
----------

- an overwhelming majority wanted to the see the library function in action.
this is going to take some work.  The database needs to keep track of who
checked out a book and the date/time.  might be nice if the system could 
email the person when it's due.  scanning in the books is actually not that
difficult using the python scripts in the library dir.  check out the 
instructions.html file.

- more poperties for the profile.  maybe a 'privacy' option for those who
don't want their transactions recorded in the transactions table.

- create COSTCO reports automatically based on current inventory stats. 

- tighten up security on chezbob.ucsd.edu.

- a better way of logging in.  Serg said he was interested in donating a 
thumbprint scanner.  that would rock.

- X interface (might want to upgrade the computer here :)
