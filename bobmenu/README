Chez Bob 2001 Installation Notes 

Michael Copenhafer (mcopenha@cs.ucsd.edu)

The current version of Chez Bob relies on several 3rd party packages:

1. Dialog: We're using a custom version of Savio Lam's Dialog program.  
The source is located in dialog-0.9a.  After checking out the source tree 
for bobmenu, you'll need to go into the dialog-0.9a directory and execute 
'./configure' followed by 'make' to create the dialog executable.  
Using dialog version dialog-0.9a-20010429 available from 
http://dickey.his.com/dialog/dialog.html.  Refer to the comments in dlg.pl
to learn about what modifications were made to the dialog code.


2. Festival speech program: http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/
The RedHat 6.2 rpm's and source code are available on this website.  Go 
to the Debian homepage to obtain the necessary Debian packages.  At a 
minimum, you'll need to install the main festival package 
festival_1.4.1-1.deb in addition to at least one dictionary (package 
names begin with 'festlex') and at least one voice package 
(package names begin with 'festvox'). Here are the dictionaries we 
installed: 

festlex-cmu_1.4.0-1.deb        
festlex-oald_1.4.0-1.deb       
festlex-poslex_1.4.0-1.deb     

and the voices:

festvox-kdlpc16k_1.4.0-1.deb
festvox-rablpc16k_1.4.0-1.deb
festvox-don_1.4.0-1.deb        
festvox-kallpc16k_1.4.0-1.deb

You'll also need to install the 'speech tools' library:

speech-tools1_1.4.1-1.deb
speech-tools-bin_1.4.1-1.deb

the following development packages are optional:

speech-tools-dev_1.4.1-1.deb
festival-dev_1.4.1-1.deb       

Festival also depends on the 'enlightened sound daemon' package:

esound-common_0.2.17-7.deb  
esound_0.2.17-7.deb  

If you do an 'apt-get install festival', the installer is smart enough
to install most of the dependent packages, but it seems to miss the 
main esound package esound_0.2.17-7.deb.  Also note that the above command
does not install a voice or a dictionary; you'll have to do that by hand.  

It's possible to switch among the different voices by altering the 
file /usr/lib/festival/voices.scm.  Scroll down to the declaration of 
default-voice-priority-list (~ line 178) and place the voice you want to
test at the beginning of the list.  I've personally tried all of them, 
and I find the English voice (en1) and American female (us1_mbrola) to
be the most intelligible.


3. MBROLA speech synthesizer: The above installation of festival works
fine, but some of the default voices are not particularly good.  I'm not
familiar with the specifics, but festival can be used in conjunction with
another speech synthesizer called 'Mbrola' to use a set of different 
voices, some of which are superior to festival's.  Check out 
http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html and download the Mbrola
binaries for Linux; install the mbrola executable in /usr/local/bin. 
Then download the following voices:

en1-980910.zip  
us1-980512.zip  
us2-980812.zip  
us3-990208.zip


4. Speechd: this is a simple Perl script that sets up a /dev/speech device.
Download it from www.speechio.org.


5. Apache + Php

apache-common_1.3.9-13.2.deb  
apache_1.3.9-13.2.deb        
libmm10_1.0.11-1.deb          
php4-pgsql_4.0.3pl1-0potato1.deb
php4_4.0.3pl1-0potato1.deb
