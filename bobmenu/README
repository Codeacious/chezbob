Build Notes 

Michael Copenhafer (mcopenha@cs.ucsd.edu)

We're using a custom version of Savio Lam's Dialog program.  The source is
located in dialog-0.9a.  After checking out the source tree, you'll need to 
go into the dialog-0.9a directory and execute './configure' followed by 
'make' to create the dialog executable.  Move the dialog executable to the
parent directory.
